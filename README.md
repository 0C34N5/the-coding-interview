# The Coding Interview

Over the next few weeks I will try to solve some of the coding problems in this
repository in Python, C, Java and maybe others.


Currently, this is a collection of the following resources:

  * [blakeembrey/code-problems](https://github.com/blakeembrey/code-problems)
  * [Simeon Willbanks Repo](https://github.com/simeonwillbanks/google-interview-questions/tree/master/questions)
  * [Arden Dertat's posts](http://www.ardendertat.com/2012/01/09/programming-interview-questions/)
  * [jonnii/interview-questions](https://github.com/jonnii/interview-questions)
  * [ofirpicazo/interview-questions](https://github.com/ofirpicazo/interview-questions/tree/master/python)
  * [Google Code Jam Problems](https://code.google.com/codejam/)

More to come.
